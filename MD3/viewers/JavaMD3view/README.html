<h1>Java MD3 Model Viewer</h1>

<p>The Java MD3 Model Viewer is a windowed Java program that uses OpenGL to
display a Quake 3 .md3 model file on the screen.

<p>The Java source code (which is provided under the GNU General Public License),
together with its javadoc documentation, is included! You
can find it in the sources.zip file that comes with the distribution.

<p>The latest version of this program and tips and tricks for efficient use can
be found on the <a href="http://fragland.net/md3view">Java MD3 Model Viewer Home Page</a>
(http://fragland.net/md3view).

<h2><a name="WHATS_NEW">What's New?</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>New in version 1.2.3
  <ul>
  <li>The different animation types, data source types and render types are now represented using the typesafe enum pattern.
  <li>Animation definitions in an animation.cfg file that are illegal for a certain model are now ignored.
  <li>Selecting 'Model | Properties' when a texture is displayed will now show some texture properties.
  <li>Added 'export texture coordinate maps' functionality. Skinners will love this! The function will export
      all texture coordinate information of a model to 2D UV-map images.
  <li>Fixed bug in pak file browser causing i.e. 'MODELS' and 'models' to be displayed as different directories.
  <li>Double clicking on .shader files in the pak file tree now shows their text content.
  <li>Improved MD3IO.readName() method.
  <li>DXF exporter no longer writes multiple file footers in exported file.
  <li>Fixed stupid bug in animation.cfg loader.
  <li>Added render info function to help menu. This will display information about the OpenGL system
      used to render the models.
  <li>Fixed artefacts-during-interpolated-animation bug. On some models it's not completely gone yet,
      but this is due to float rounding and can't really be fixed...
  <li>Fixed bug in MD3 loader code that caused failed loads of models with no texture definitions.
      Props go to Tom Naughton for pointing this out!
  <li>Restructured code: md3.md3view package now has sub-packages visitor and glmodel.
  <li>Fixed some textures don't load bug: non-mipmapped OpenGL textures should have a width and height of
      64, 128 or 256! Textures that do not comply to this rule are now clipped (i.e. the texture
      'models/mapobjects/teleporter/energy.jpg' is clipped from 64x126 to 64x64).
      If the viewer detects that mipmapping is possible (GL4Java 2.1.2.1 or later) it will not clip the
      textures but wil use mipmapping!
  <li>New email address: <tt>klr8@fragland.net</tt>.
  <li>Fixed bug causing player model assembly to be interupted by missing .skin files.
  <li>Fixed bug causing screenshots to have strange deformations. (Thanks to Sven Goethel for the tips!)
  <li>Fixed searchForPath method not able to deal with backslash bug.
  <li>First command line argument can now also be a pak file name or a directory. This way you can tell the program on 
      startup which .pk3 file to open or from which directory files should initially be loaded.
  <li>Fixed .obj texture coordinate export and face orientation problems. (Thanks to dAVE for the help!)
  <li>Added background color selection functionality using the JColorChooser class.
  <li>Looping frames are now used correctely during animation. The last 'looping number'
      frames of the animation are repeated, the first few frames are only played once.
  <li>Integrated an MD3 save function and import 3DS function, both written by Donald Gray. So the viewer now
      allows you to convert 3D Studio .3ds files into MD3 files! (This functionality is still disabled because
      it is not robust enough yet.)
  <li>The 'save screenshot' functionality now makes use of the LittleEndianDataOutputStream class that Donald
      Gray contributed.
  </ul>
<li>New in version 1.2.2
  <ul>
  <li>There's a new splash screen and icon, made by David 'dines' Durrenberger.
  <li>The apply submenu of the file menu moved to the model menu.
  <li>Added export to the Alias Wavefront .obj file format. This also exports the vertex normals and texture
      coordinates.
  <li>The different parts of a player model are now automatically assembled when you open one part. This makes
      viewing of player models much easier: just open "lower.md3"! You can disable this function in the options.      
  <li>Added detach part functionality to model menu.
  <li>Made some animation names more verbose.
  <li>Fixed bug where textures cannot be viewed before a model has been opened. Also, texture modes no longer affect
      the texture viewer.
  <li>Added apply texture to mesh functionality. A menu will allow you to apply a texture (.jpg or .tga) to a
      particular mesh of a model (i.s.o. to the entire model, as is the case with the old apply texture function).
  <li>Textures are now exported to the same directory as the .wrl file when exporting a model to VRML97, unless
      this option is turned off in the options panel. Thus it is no longer necessary to manually extract
      the textures from the pak and edit the .wrl to update the texture URLs!
  <li>Line breaks are added as needed in the mesh names list of the model properties.
  <li>The program is now 'officially' distributed under the GNU General Public License. This was allready
      the case in the past (because the program builds on GL4Java - which is LGPL - and the Mental Vortex
      MD3View - which is GPL -). The GPL itself is accessible from the help menu.
  <li>Fixed bug in VRML97 exporter that caused generation of corrupt .wrl files when a model with
      missing textures was exported.
  <li>Donald Gray contributed to the project by writing a Autocad DXF exporter.
  </ul>
<li>New in version 1.2.1
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed bone frames having all kinds of colors. Also, the position data member of a boneframe is now drawn.
      The boneframes are green, the model itself white, the boneframe position red and the vertex normals yellow.
  <li>Garbage characters are now filtered from the tag, mesh, model and texture names.
  <li>Added animation properties button to the animation control panel.
  <li>The default 'All Frames' animation, which plays all available animation frames, is now
      allways present, also when the animation.cfg file is found. (Easy when debugging your
      animation.cfg file).
  <li>MD3 loader is more robust: it now correctely deals with non-default offsets
      for the different data parts of the file.
  <li>Changed some animation names based on info from Paul Steed.
  <li>Added show vertex normals function to view menu.
  <li>Added PLG export function.
  <li>Added support for sex, headoffset and footsteps in animation.cfg loader. Also fixed TORSO_OFFSET
      compensation code in CFGIO.
  <li>The meaning of the unknown bytes in the MD3 format is now known and the md3.md3model
      package was modified accordingly (Big thanks to HK Developments!).
  <li>JPG textures are now supported (they're used from the Q3DemoTest on).
  <li>Added option panel, accessible from the options item in the file menu, which lets you
      control the display of error messages, auto skin loading and jpg texture loading.
  <li>Default rendering mode is now FLAT_TEXTURED (i.s.o. SHADED_TEXTURED).
  <li>Model properties output now contains mesh names.
  <li>Added close model function to file menu.
  <li>Reorgenized menus: there's now a model menu, which contains the tags menu. When you use
      the 'Attach File' submenu of the model menu you can attach a file to a certain tag
      position of the current model.
  <li>Animation control panel moved to tab on right side of viewer. Also, it's now in a seperate
      class: MD3ViewAnimationControl.
  <li>Lots of small code changes all over the program to provide pak file support (i.e. in the
      searchForPath method).
  <li>Added full featured pak file browser: you can view text files, apply skins, view textures,
      load models, ... directely from a .pk3 file! Right click on a node in the pak file tree
      for a popup menu with lots of new functions!
  <li>Changed float[] in Vec3 to 3 seperate floats. This lead to a 25% performance improvement
      during interpolated animation. However, the cost is less elegant code.
  <li>Fixed bug in blending code: glDepthMask(GL_FALSE) needed for transparent meshes.
  <li>Command line support is back. The first command line argument, if present, will be intepreted as
      the name of an .md3 file that should be opened.
  <li>Fixed small mistake in light source setup.
  <li>Cleaned up OpenGL code a bit which led to some performance improvements.
  <li>Last directory from which a file was opened and last directory to which a file was saved
      are now maintained independently.
  <li>Added save screenshot function to the file menu. This will save the viewport to a Targa file.
  <li>Fixed some NullPointer bugs (in MD3GLModelFactory and MD3View).
  </ul>
<li>New in version 1.2
  <ul>
  <li>Added crude filename filtering to open-file dialog boxes and default save-filename to
      save-file dialog boxes.
  <li>Added import skin function to file menu. This allows you to import a .skin file (they
      come with player models).
  <li>Added show bone frame box function to view menu. This allows you to display the bounding
      boxes of the models for each animation frame.
  <li>The properties function now also lists the number of tags. Also changed layout of output.
  <li>Changed MD3 loader. It now also supports the <i>hand</i> models, i.e. shotgun_hand.md3.
  		These hand models contain no meshes (and thus no vertex and triangle data), only animation
  		frames to animate the use and changing of the weapon in question. Load one and attach
  		a weapon to the weapon tag and you'll understand...
  <li>Added transparency. Transparency is processed on a per mesh bases, so some meshes in
      a model can be transparent while other meshes in the same model are not. Currently 
      transparency is determined based on the mesh name stored in the .md3 files (hack :).
  <li>Restructured the code: the general MD3 model classes are now in a package md3.md3model,
      the viewer specific ones are in md3.md3view and general utility classes reside in the
      md3.util package.
  <li>Completely redid animation system. The animation config files (animation.cfg),
      that accompany the player models, are now parsed and the information in them
      is used to enable you to play the different animations defined for the player
      models. Interpolation between key frames was also added and can be toggled on and off.
  <li>Added gray scale and 24 bit color map support to the TGA file loader. This was
      necessary because a new texture in Q3T 1.07 (pole.tga) is an 8 bit gray scale
      Targa image.
  <li>Added quick manipulations function to view menu. This will switch the view to
      wire frame mode while the user manipulates the model (rotate, scale, ...).
      If you have a slow GL card you'll like this! 
  </ul>
<li>New in version 1.1
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed textures displaying strange bug.
  <li>Improved model and texture loading performance using buffers.
  <li>Added panning of model using shift + drag with first mouse button.
  <li>Added reset view function to view menu to reset manipulations (scale, rotate and pan) of view.
  <li>Added properties function to file menu to display some stats about the model (nr. of triangles, vertices, ...).
  <li>Kicked out command line argument support.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="INSTALLATION">Installation</a></h2>

<h3>Upgrading a previous version</h3>

<p>Upgrading a (old) working version of the Java MD3 Model viewer is very simple: just replace
your old md3view.jar file with the new one (make sure you're not running the viewer while doing this)!

<h3>Installing it as an application</h3>

<h4>Easy Win32 installation instructions</h4>

<p>On Win32, follow these simple required-software-installation-steps:
<ol>
<li>Install the Java Runtime by executing the installer exe. In the following steps I assume that you
install this to C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.<i>J</i> (where <i>J</i> is a Java version number, i.e. 3).
<li>Unzip libGL4Java2.<i>X.Y.Z</i>-Win32-x86.zip to C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.<i>J</i>\bin (<i>X.Y.Z</i> is a GL4Java version number).
<li>Unzip gl4java2.<i>X.Y.Z</i>-jar.zip to C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.<i>J</i>\lib\ext (You might have to create the ext subdirectory!).
<li>Download the Java MD3 Model Viewer and unzip the distribution to a directory of your choice.
</ol>

<h4>General installation instructions (mostly for non Win32 users)</h4>

<p>Any OpenGL capable system (Linux, Solaris, WinNT, SGI, ...) should suffice to run the viewer. Most people
will use the program as a normal application. If you want to do that, follow these instructions (If you're
new to Java, you might want to read the <a href="#JAVA_NEWBIE_TIPS">Java Newbie Tips</a> first):

  <ol>
  <li>Get and install <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/">Java 1.2.x or later</a>.
  You need either the Java SDK or Runtime.
  Both are available from Sun at: <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>.
  <li>Get and install <a href="http://www.jausoft.com/">GL4Java</a>, the Java OpenGL binding.
  You will need at least version 2.0.1.1 of GL4Java!
  You can get it at <a href="http://www.jausoft.com/">http://www.jausoft.com</a>.
  (You need 2 files: for version 2.0.1.2 on a Win32 system these would be gl4java2.0.1.2.zip and libgl4java2.0.1.2-win32-x86.zip.
  Unzip the first one into the 'ext' directory of your Java Runtime. Extract the libraries in the second
  file into the 'bin' directory of your Java runtime.)
  <li>Unzip the Java MD3 Model Viewer distribution zip file into a directory of your choice.
  <li>When on a Windows system, start the md3view.bat file. On Unix machines, type the content
  of the mdview.bat file directely into your command line.<br>
  </ol>
  
<h3>Installation Problems</h3>

<ul>
<li>Error message: <tt>Execption in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: gl4java/awt/GLCanvas</tt><br>
    This is because Java can't find the 'gl4java.jar' file. Make sure you have
    <i>C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.J\lib\ext\gl4java.jar</i>
    (Note that you might have to create the 'ext' dir yourself!).
<li>Error message: <tt>bad command of file name</tt><br>
    Edit the md3view.bat file to include the directory where java.exe resides on your system, eg.
    'c:\windows\system\java -jar md3view.jar'. You can also try to double click on the md3view.jar file. On some systems this also seems to launch
    the viewer.
<li>Error message: <tt>Error occured during initialization of VM: java/lang/ClassNotFoundExpception: sun/io/ByteToCharCp1250</tt> (Or a similar message)<br>
    This is because you're using the US Java Virtual Machine version, that you downloaded from <a href="http://fragland.net/md3view/download.html">http://fragland.net/md3view/download.html</a>
    on a non US operating system (i.e. Windows 98, Polish edition). Uninstall the US JVM, then download an internationalized version of the Java Virtual Machine from
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html</a> and install that one.
</ul>
  
<h2><a name="TIPS">Tips</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>I recommend that you use the hotspot JVM (you can also get this from Sun at
<a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>) because it will greatly improve performance!
Starting from Java 1.3, the hotspot JVM is included by default.
<li>An easy way to bring the full 3d glory of your new skin to the web is by exporting your model,
with the skin applied to it, to VRML97. Now convert all textures that you use to jpg format (if necessary),
and once that's done, edit the VRML file that was generated (normally has extension .wrl) with a text
editor and change the references to the original textures to point to your .jpg textures (The references
are allready correct if your model only contained jpg textures!).
The last step is to include the
following in an HTML page (I assume the HTML page is in the same directory as the .jpg files and
your .wrl file):
  <xmp>
  <embed src="mygeneratedfile.wrl" width="99%" height="88%" vrml_dashboard="TRUE"></embed> 
  </xmp>
</ul>

<h2><a name="JAVA_NEWBIE_TIPS">Java Newbie Tips</a></h1>

<p>If you're new to Java, here are a few tips that might help you in getting Java programs,
like the Java MD3 Model Viewer, to work:
  <ul>
  <li>Java is case sensitive, like C/C++ (also on systems that are not, like Windows 98)!
  <li>Java programs can't be executed directely by your machine. You'll need a JVM (Java Virtual
  Machine), aka Java Runtime, to execute a Java program.
  <li>The Java CLASSPATH is an environment variable similar to the well known PATH environment
  variable. PATH is used to tell the OS where to find executables. CLASSPATH is used to tell
  the Java runtime where to find .class files, that is, Java executables.
  <li>A Java application is a stand-alone Java program. A Java applet is a Java program that
  runs inside of your Web browser. The Java MD3 Model viewer is a Java application.
  </ul>

<h2><a name="TODO">Todo</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>get applet stuff working properly and easily
<li>real filename filtering in file dialogs (AWT bug 4031440)
<li>add shader file support
<li>support for multiple .pk3 files open at the same time
<li>Recent models/recent pak files list
<li>Save settings on exit
<li>export to and import from XGL (http://www.xglspec.org/)
<li>...
</ul>

<h2><a name="KNOWN_BUGS_STRANGE_THINGS">Known Bugs/Strange Things</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>sensitive mouseDragged(), reacts when double clicking in file dialog
<li>debug output ("gc=0;"), this is done by the gl4java libs...has something to do with gljFree()...only happens with some OpenGL drivers...
<li>crash when you do resises of OpenGL canvas (on G400, ATI 3D Rage)...probably a problem in GL4Java...
<li>textures are not shown when model is opened using command line argument...for some strange reason GL_TEXTURE_2D is not enabled when
    texture data is uploaded?!?...probably synchronization problem between threads...
<li>strange transparency artefacts (e.g. head not blended behind flash of weapon with Anarki model)...this is a known bug :-/
<li>error "unexpected end of ZLIB inputstream" when opening models from a pak file using the JRE 1.2.1...this is problem with 1.2.1, upgrade to JRE 1.2.2 or 1.3
</ul>
