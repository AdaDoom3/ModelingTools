<title>Java MD3 Model Viewer Source Code Overview</title>

<h1>Contributing to the Java MD3 Model Viewer</h1>

<p>
The way I've done this with contributions from other people is that I
maintain the source code base. When you make modifications and additions to the
source, send them to me (the modified/added .java files), and I'll integrate
them into the source code that is later released to the public. (I know this
model is not really scalable, if more people would join in, we would probably need
something better. I don't really have any experience with open-source projects yet,
so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!)
</p>

<p>
As you probably have noticed, the viewer uses the GPL license, so all your
code would become available together with the viewer!
</p>

<p>
Also, I guess it would be good for the project if you 'somewhat' adhere to
the coding style I (and others who contributed) used.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, do anything you like! :-) Try to fix bugs that are still
there, add features you think are missing, ... whatever you want!
</p>

<h1>Source code structure overview</h1>

<p>
Just a bit of explanation about the source:

<ul>
<li>
<b>package md3.md3model:</b>
<p>
    This package contains the base API for input (later maybe output) of.md3
files and all related files (i.e. animation.cfg, *.jpg, ...). The data
classes in the package use the 'composite pattern': an MD3 model is actually
a hierarchy of MD3Model objects. The MD3Model objects support visitors so
functionality can easily be added on top of the data hierarchy. The package
also uses the 'abstract factory' pattern: users of the package should use
MD3ModelFactory to get instances of the classes in the package. Some
of the classes in the package also use this factory (i.e. MD3IO). That way,
the users of the API can subclass the MD3ModelFactory class and have the
package use their own subclasses instead of the classes provided in the
package itself (the viewer uses this technique).
</p>
<p>
    As a final remark: this package should only contain data directly
related to the md3 data format, so i.e. OpenGL specific state data is not
stored here! (Remark: the ThreeDSIO class shouldn't really be here...:-)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package md3.util:</b>
<p>
    Package with general utility classes useful when dealing with MD3 model
data.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package md3.md3view:</b>
<p>
    The classes provided here implement the actual GUI and GUI logic of the
viewer. The viewer uses a subclass of the md3.md3model.MD3ModelFactory class
to create objects suited for display (i.e. with OpenGL display state data).
</p>
<p>
    The most important class by far is the MD3View class (the main class of
the viewer). 2 methods in this class are of particular importance:
searchForPath() and getInputStreamForPath(). You can use these methods to
get an input stream for a certain file using all 'data sources' known to the
viewer at a certain time. This way you can write code that reads files from
either the .pk3 files or directly from the file system.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package md3.md3view.glmodel:</b>
<p>
    The classes in this package subclass classes in md.md3model and
OpenGL state data to them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package md3.md3view.visitor:</b>
<p>
    This package contains visitors for the MD3 model data hierarchy
maintained by the viewer. Most of the functionality of the viewer is provided
using a visitor (i.e. exporting of data, drawing of models, ...)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package cio:</b>
<p>
    This package contains input & output streams to do endian order switches
necessary when reading & writing C data from Intel CPUs.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package widgets.awt:</b>
<p>
    Additional widgets (i.e. a Tree) used by the viewer not provided in the
standard AWT.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>package widgets.awt.event:</b>
<p>
    Event classes used by new widgets.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
