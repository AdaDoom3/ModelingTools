Example how to export a md5 model from blender. You could vary this in a lot of ways but it's a "KISS" example to show it's working.

1) Build a mesh

2) Attach mesh to bones
   a) Enter 'pose mode'.
   b) Select the mesh first then select the bone you want to attach to.
   c) Hit CTRL+P, choose armature deform and with automatic weights.

3) Do armature deforms for mesh objects on property tab
   a) Click add modifier, Choose Deform, Choose Armature
   b) Select bone object, bind to vertex group must be active

4) Do single frame animation for all mesh parts
   * All parts must be listed on dope sheet and have an action
   * Action editor needs to have the whole animation under the same name, no different animations for hands etc

5) Attach all mesh parts to vertex group
   a) Select all of them
   b) Join them
   c) Select the whole
   d) In properties tab click the down pointing triangle, add vertex group and name it

6) Select everything
   a) Enter 'object mode'
   b) Hit A-A

7) Choose the action for the action editor as active

8) Click export
